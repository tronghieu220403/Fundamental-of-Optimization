To know what to do, read README.txt
Your input data is in data.inp
For heuristic code, run TestGeneratorForHeur.py
For heuristic code with small data, run HeuristicSolverForSmallData.py
For heuristic code with large data, run Heuristic.exe
To see heuristic code for large data, open Heuristic.cpp
All of your heuristic answers will be in HeuristicAns.out
For correct CP code, run TestGeneratorForCP.py and your answer is in CorrectAns.out
To crawl data, I ran ClaimData.py
To see my crawled data, open RunData.out or RunData.xlsx
