To know what to do, read README.txt
Input data is in data.inp
For test cases generation, run TestGenerator.py
For heuristic code with small data, run HeuristicSolverForSmallData.py, answer will be in HeuristicAns2.out
For heuristic code with large data, run Heuristic.exe
To see heuristic code for large data, open Heuristic.cpp
My heuristic answer will be in HeuristicAns.out
For correct CP code, run Correct_CP_SAT_Solver.py and your answer is in CorrectAns.out
